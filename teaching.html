<h2>Thesis Supervision</h2>
<p>I'm happy to supervise Bachelor and Master theses, as well as independent study projects of Aalborg University students. Such projects or theses should roughly fall into the research area of interactive systems. I am (in no particular order) primarily interested in:
<ul>
<li>Mobile interaction</li>
<li>Mixed and virtual reality</li>
<li>Text entry and emoji</li>
<li>Haptic feedback</li>
<li>Casual and subtle interactions</li>
<li>Ubiquitous and wearable computing</li>
<li>Natural user interfaces</li>
</ul>
If you are interested in any of these topics feel free to contact me. You can bring in your own project idea, or we can find something for you.
